Emm Automatic Isolate Labeller


Thank you for visiting the remote repository for emm Automatic Isolate Labeller (EmMAIL).

EmMail is an ongoing project of a bioinformatics student as a capstone project. 

EmMAIL is a command line tool for emm-type classification of Streptococcus pyogenes based on the isolate's whole genome sequencing reads.

Input	: FASTA set of WGS reads of a Streptococcus pyogenes isolate
Output	: Predicted emm type of the isolate

The use of EmMAIL will follow the dependencies of the tools within its pipeline, namely SRST2 and SPAdes (version TBC).

This README file will be filled as soon as possible.

Comments and suggestions can be sent to andre.sutanto.91@gmail.com.
